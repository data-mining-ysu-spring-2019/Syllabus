Conceptual

1. The process of DM. Data types.
2. Simple Linear Regression (t-statistics, R-squared, non-linear forms)
3. Multiple linear Regression (matrix formulations).
4. Poisson Regression: model formulation, explanation.
5. Poisson Regression: goodness of fit, overdispersion.
6. Regularization: bias-variance trade-off, multicollinearity, n>p, subset selection, shrinkage.
7. Regularization: RR, LASSO, EN, cross-validation
8. K-NN (classification and regression, choosing k and overfitting)
9. Desicion Tree (Teminology, CART (Gini, Entropy, Error rate), CHAID,Pruning, Overfitting, Model evaluation,  Interpretations) 
10. Ensemble Methods (Types, Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest)
11. Cluster analysis (Types of clusterings and clusters) + k-means (The logic, Choosing k, Bisecting k-means, limitations)
12. Cluster analysis (Types of clusterings and clusters) + Hierarchical Clustering (The logic + Linkages)
13. Survival Analysis
